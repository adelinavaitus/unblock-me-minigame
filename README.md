# Unblock Me MiniGame 

This is a Unblock Me-inspired puzzle game built with Unity. The game challenges players to maneuver a set of blocks through a grid, attempting to move a specific block to the exit by moving other blocks around. The game mechanics focus on controlling the player’s block within a confined grid while avoiding obstacles and strategizing the optimal movement sequence.

This project was created for the Multimedia Applications course as part of my university studies, with the goal of demonstrating the use of Unity in developing interactive games.

## Features 
- Grid-based movement: The player can move a block horizontally within a confined grid, with movement restricted by obstacles.
- Multiple obstacles: There are various obstacles placed within the grid, which the player must avoid while trying to reach the goal.
- Level progression: Players can progress to the next level once they successfully move the player’s block to the exit.
- Pause and Resume functionality: The game allows players to pause and resume gameplay, giving them a chance to take a break while keeping their progress.
- Menu Navigation: Players can navigate through different menus including the main menu, pause menu, and settings.

## Controls
- Drag to Move: Click and drag the player block to move it along the X-axis.
-  Pause: Press the pause button to access the pause menu, where you can resume the game, quit, or go to the main menu.
- Audio: Adjust the game volume in the settings menu.
